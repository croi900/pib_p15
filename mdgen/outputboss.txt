## Vocabulary:
- Pythagorean Theorem
- Euclidean geometry
- Digital Image Compression
- Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)

## Introduction:
In this lesson, we will explore the Pythagorean Theorem, a fundamental concept in mathematics, and its practical application in Euclidean geometry. Additionally, we will delve into the world of digital image compression, specifically focusing on the discrete cosine transform (DCT) used in JPEG compression.

## Pythagorean Theorem:
The Pythagorean Theorem, attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras, is a fundamental relation in Euclidean geometry. It states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \]

Where:
- \( a \) and \( b \) are the lengths of the two shorter sides (legs) of the right triangle.
- \( c \) is the length of the hypotenuse.

The Pythagorean Theorem is widely used in various fields such as architecture, engineering, and physics.

## Digital Image Compression:
JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a commonly used image compression standard that employs a lossy form of compression based on the discrete cosine transform (DCT). The DCT is a mathematical operation that converts each frame or field of a video source from the spatial domain into the frequency domain. This transformation allows for efficient representation of image data while reducing file size.

## Conclusion:
Understanding the Pythagorean Theorem provides a solid foundation in geometry and mathematics, while knowledge of digital image compression techniques like DCT is essential in the field of multimedia and technology. By mastering these concepts, you will be equipped to explore more advanced topics in mathematics and digital media.

Now, let's apply our knowledge of the Pythagorean Theorem and digital image compression to solve problems and analyze real-world scenarios.### Additional Information:

#### Pythagorean Theorem:
- **Definition:** In mathematics, the Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.
- **Formula:** If a and b are the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right triangle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse, the theorem can be expressed as: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \).
- **Applications:** The Pythagorean Theorem is widely used in various fields such as physics, engineering, architecture, and more for calculating distances, determining angles, and solving real-world problems involving right triangles.

#### JPEG Compression:
- **Definition:** JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a commonly used method for compressing digital images. It uses a lossy compression technique, which means that some data is lost during the compression process to reduce the file size.
- **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT):** DCT is a mathematical technique used in JPEG compression to convert spatial data (pixel values) into frequency components. This transformation helps in reducing redundancy in the image data and allows for more efficient compression.
- **Spatial Domain:** In the context of image processing, the spatial domain refers to the representation of an image in terms of its spatial coordinates (pixels) and their intensity values.

#### Euclidean Geometry:
- **Definition:** Euclidean geometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of geometric shapes and their properties based on the principles laid out by the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid.
- **Key Concepts:** Euclidean geometry includes topics such as points, lines, angles, polygons, circles, and the relationships between them. It forms the foundation of geometric reasoning and is essential in various mathematical and practical applications.
